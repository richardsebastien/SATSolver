@Description: This is the main file for the SAT solver. It will read the input file, and then call the functions to solve the SAT problem.
@Input: The input file is a text file with the following format: each line is a clause, and each number is a literal.
@Output: The output is a text file with the following format: the first line is the number of variables, and the second line is the assignment of the variables.
