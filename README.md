**Description :** *This project is a SAT solver that takes a text file as input and returns a solution if it exists.*

**Utilisation :** *To use this solver, simply run the script `main.py` passing the path of the text file containing the SAT formula as an argument.*

**Example :** `python3 main.py test.txt`

**Note :** *The text file must be in the following format : each line is a clause, and each number is a literal.*

**Example :**
    
    ```
    -1 2 3 -5 -4
    -2
    1 2 4
    -2 3
    2 5
    3 -4
    ```
